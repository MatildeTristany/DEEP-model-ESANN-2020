Equilibrium Propagation for Complete Directed Neural Networks

> Artificial neural networks, one of the most successful approaches to supervised learning, were originally inspired by their biological counterparts. However, the most successful learning algorithm for artificial neural networks, backpropagation, is considered biologically implausible. This work aims to contribute to the topic of biologically plausible neural learning by building upon and extending the equilibrium propagation model introduced by [Scellier and Bengio (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179). Specifically, we introduce: a new neuronal dynamics and learning rule for arbitrary network architectures; a sparsity-inducing method able to prune irrelevant connections; a dynamical-systems characterization of the models, using Lyapunov theory.

The DEEP model here implemented is described by [Equilibrium Propagation for Complete Directed Neural Networks](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mma/dissertacao/283828618790517), by Matilde Tristany Farinha, Sérgio Pequito, Pedro A. Santos and Mário T. Figueiredo.
